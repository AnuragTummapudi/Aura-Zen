# Aura Zen

## Short Description
Aura Zen is an AI-powered personalized assistant designed to provide emotional support and encouragement. It detects the user's mood, listens attentively, and suggests activities to improve mental well-being. Acting as a supportive friend rather than a therapist, Aurazen offers a temporary companion for those seeking motivation and comfort in their daily lives.

## **Problem Statement**  

In today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with stress, loneliness, and a lack of motivation, often finding it difficult to express their emotions or seek timely support. While therapy is an effective long-term solution, it is not always immediately accessible due to cost, stigma, or availability.  

There is a need for a temporary, non-intrusive solution that provides emotional companionship, encourages mental well-being, and suggests mood-based activities without replacing professional therapy.  

Aura Zen aims to bridge this gap by offering an AI-powered personalized assistant that detects the user's mood, listens to them like a supportive friend, and recommends activities to enhance their well-being. By integrating real-time mood analysis and personalized interactions, Aurazen provides a comforting presence while encouraging users to take steps toward self-improvement.
